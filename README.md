WARNING: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LOST DATA, OR MISUSE OF AI. KEEP BACKUPS OF ANY FILES YOU USE THIS '3/4-MIRROR-CIPHER' ON. THIS IS A PRE-BETA PROGRAM AND ANY DATA YOU CODE THIS WAY IS VERY LIKELY TO BE CORRUPTED AND LOST FOREVER, OPTIMIZATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE, AND IT IS NOT YET A DEPENDABLE PRODUCT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.


Something that I've noticed is that AI is *incredibly* bad at math. No offence to the developers out there, I absolutely love you and the machines you have trained. However, there are some major flaws in the current approach that everyone seems to be using. First, even though AI can now write code, it fails to employ any code which it can write. For example, if you ask an AI to generate a number in a base system of great size, it will generally fail to do so correctly, even though it lists out all the right steps to do so. A simple solution is to give the Ai access to byte code so that it can compile and run the scripts that it writes. Then it has a calculator running on bare-metal, and it won't make the same mistakes when asked. A more interesting solution, is to provide the AI with a virtual machine environment that has certain rules which make it impossible to make certain mistakes. For example, one could write a system of nested files and use the python 'os' module to give an AI on your machine the ability to navigate directories based on certain instructions. Built into these folders are text documents which the AI is required to access to receive a 'bit key.' Each folder represents the ouput of a logic gate. It uses that bit key to navigate the folders and comes out with the desired outputs as they might be represented by an led on a breadboard. I put an example FULL ADDER together this way. Training an Ai in an environment like this, even a more extensive environment like a whole ALU, entire CPU, etc, may give Ai the tools to perform extremely simple logical operations SEMANTICALLY, which it is not currently capable of doing with any degree of reliablility. Semantic fluency will give AI a big boost in how well it reads, writes, and 'rithmatics. 
Dictionary of Terms:


VCPU: Virtual Central Processing Unit; a virtual device comprised of specially structured file-system, which is typically located on one fast hard-drive. Documents can be efficiently manipulated by a normal CPU in their zipped formats, and the AI uses the extracted pre-code (Virtual Bits) to operate/navigate the Virtual Transistor-Like Environment. Using virtual/real address system, the AI places the appropriate values in Virtual Registers, which are composed of Virtual Flip-Flops. Print("The appropriate values (Virtual Bits,Flag Bits) and (Surface-Level Queue of Programs and AI Outputs) are chosen from an AIIS, which is interpreted by the AIIC.")))

The VCPU will be capable of speeding up existing hardware by infering on the AI level details about operations. Today's microarchitexture is doing this as well using the concept of "pipelining," which may use static registers or other things to "guess" and "remember" what should be done in a sequence. 

The VCPU is also capable of increasing the intelligence of the AI, by allowing us to abstract problems that are too complicated for current AI to solve.

AIIC: AI Interpreter/Compiler; An API which allows an AI to interpret AIIS and AIDS. 

AIDS: AI Driven Script; A program that is intended to be interpreted at the AI level, not the interpreter level.

VTLE: Virtual Transistor-Like Environment; An assembly-language environment dependent on specially written scripts and APIs which enable an AI to power advances in software (and AI) related to Virtual Operating Systems.

AIIS: AI Interpreted Software; A piece of software that may or may not have a GUI that is driven primarily by an AI, not by the software's direct interaction with hardware.
