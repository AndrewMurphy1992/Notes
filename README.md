Dictionary of Terms:


VCPU: Virtual Central Processing Unit; a virtual device comprised of specially structured file-system, which is typically located on one fast hard-drive. Documents can be efficiently manipulated by a normal CPU in their zipped formats, and the AI uses the extracted pre-code (Virtual Bits) to operate/navigate the Virtual Transistor-Like Environment. Using virtual/real address system, the AI places the appropriate values in Virtual Registers, which are composed of Virtual Flip-Flops. Print("The appropriate values (Virtual Bits,Flag Bits) and (Surface-Level Queue of Programs and AI Outputs) are chosen from an AIIS, which is interpreted by the AIIC.")))

The VCPU will be capable of speeding up existing hardware by infering on the AI level details about operations. Today's microarchitexture is doing this as well using the concept of "pipelining," which may use static registers or other things to "guess" and "remember" what should be done in a sequence. 

The VCPU is also capable of increasing the intelligence of the AI, by allowing us to abstract problems that are too complicated for current AI to solve.

AIIC: AI Interpreter/Compiler; An API which allows an AI to interpret AIIS and AIDS. 

AIDS: AI Driven Script; A program that is intended to be interpreted at the AI level, not the interpreter level.

VTLE: Virtual Transistor-Like Environment; An assembly-language environment dependent on specially written scripts and APIs which enable an AI to power advances in software (and AI) related to Virtual Operating Systems.

AIIS: AI Interpreted Software; A piece of software that may or may not have a GUI that is driven primarily by an AI, not by the software's direct interaction with hardware.
